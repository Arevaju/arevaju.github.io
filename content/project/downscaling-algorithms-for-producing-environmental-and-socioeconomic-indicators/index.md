In order to improve the relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of policy making, it is essential to count on indicators that can help to better understand the drivers for environmental and social development. From base indicators (environmental, socio-economic and demographic), the method developed within the framework of the FUORE project can generate more detailed maps (i.e., downscaling), in terms of spatial resolution, using “ancillary” datasets which covariate with the source indicator.
