  The main goal of this project was to assess climate change effects on bird’s migration through the development of machine learning and statistical models on behalf of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) funded by the Copernicus Earth Observation Programme. Specifically, two different spatially explicit indicators were quantified at the EU scale to monitor the  impact of climate change on ecosystems through migratory birds: 1) the progression of bird migration in Europe during spring (please see [here](https://birdmigration.climate.copernicus.eu/the-progression-of-bird-migration)), and 2) the changes in spring arrival dates occurring over the last decades (please see [here](https://birdmigration.climate.copernicus.eu/changes-in-the-migration-dates)).
